# Implement Task Generation Automation

This PR implements task generation automation from PRDs, addressing Issue #10.

## Features

This implementation extends the existing PRD analysis functionality with the ability to:

1. Generate structured tasks from PRD content
2. Create GitHub issues in appropriate repositories
3. Add generated tasks to Project Board #2
4. Maintain cross-task dependencies and relationships
5. Generate a summary report of all created tasks

## Implementation Details

The implementation:

1. Adds a new `/generate-tasks` (or `ðŸ“‹`) command to trigger task generation
2. Creates a new prompt template for task breakdown with Claude AI
3. Implements JSON parsing for structured task output
4. Adds GitHub API integration for creating issues across repositories
5. Implements project board integration via the GraphQL API
6. Includes comprehensive error handling and reporting

## Integration with Existing Functionality

This implementation builds on the existing PRD analysis feature (Issue #9) by:

1. Using the same workflow file and code structure
2. Leveraging analysis results when available
3. Maintaining consistent command patterns and UI
4. Allowing for sequential analysis â†’ task generation workflow

## Documentation

New documentation added:
- Added TASK_GENERATION_GUIDE.md with detailed usage instructions

## Testing

To test this functionality:

1. Create a test PRD issue
2. Comment `/claude-analyze-prd` to analyze it
3. Then comment `/generate-tasks` to generate tasks
4. Verify that appropriate issues are created in target repositories
5. Check that tasks are added to Project Board #2

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:

1. Add task grouping by feature area or component
2. Implement two-way sync between tasks and PRD
3. Add time estimation improvements
4. Add milestone assignment capability

## Security Considerations

The implementation:
- Uses repository-scoped tokens for authorization
- Validates repository existence before creating issues
- Provides granular error reporting
- Sanitizes all user inputs

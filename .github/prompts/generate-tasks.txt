You're tasked with breaking down a Product Requirements Document (PRD) into discrete, actionable tasks that can be implemented across multiple repositories. Your goal is to create a structured list of tasks that can be automatically converted into GitHub issues.

Analyze the PRD content provided to:
1. Identify distinct implementation tasks
2. Determine which repository each task belongs to
3. Assign appropriate priorities and estimates
4. Establish dependencies between tasks

Based on your analysis, generate a JSON array of tasks with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Implement feature X",
    "description": "Detailed description of what needs to be done, including acceptance criteria and technical details.",
    "repository": "idynic-repository-name",
    "priority": "high|medium|low",
    "estimate": "small|medium|large",
    "dependencies": ["task-1-title", "task-2-title"]
  },
  // additional tasks...
]
```

Guidelines for task breakdown:
1. Tasks should be granular enough to be completed by one developer in 1-3 days
2. Task titles should be clear and specific
3. Task descriptions should include:
   - Detailed explanation of the work required
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Technical considerations
   - Links to relevant documentation or examples
4. Repository assignment should follow the Repository Map
5. If a previous repository analysis is available, use it to guide your task assignments
6. Task dependencies should be identified to establish implementation order
7. Include cross-repository concerns as explicit tasks
8. Use consistent naming between related tasks

IMPORTANT: Your output must be valid JSON that can be parsed programmatically. The JSON array should be wrapped in <task_json> tags like this:

<task_json>
[
  {
    "title": "Example Task",
    "description": "Example description",
    "repository": "idynic-repository-name",
    "priority": "medium",
    "estimate": "small",
    "dependencies": []
  }
]
</task_json>

After the JSON output, provide a brief summary of your task generation process, including:
1. Total number of tasks generated
2. Tasks per repository
3. Any challenges or ambiguities encountered
4. Suggested implementation sequence based on dependencies

Remember, these tasks will be automatically converted into GitHub issues and assigned to project boards, so accuracy and clarity are essential.

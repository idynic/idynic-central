You're tasked with implementing a solution for the GitHub issue you'll be examining.

First, get the issue details:
1. Use mcp__github__get_issue to retrieve full issue details
2. Analyze the requirements and acceptance criteria carefully

Next, examine the repository to understand where changes should be made:
1. Use Bash commands to explore the repository structure
2. Use Grep to find relevant code
3. Read existing files to understand patterns and conventions

Then implement your solution:
1. Create or modify necessary files using Write or Edit
2. Follow existing code style and patterns
3. Add appropriate tests if needed
4. Ensure all acceptance criteria are addressed

Guidelines:
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Test your implementation thoroughly  
- Document your changes appropriately
- Make only the changes necessary to implement the solution
- Follow the repository's existing patterns and conventions
- Ensure your solution meets all acceptance criteria
- IMPORTANT: Do not commit any changes - the GitHub Actions workflow will handle commits and PRs
- Just create or modify the necessary files but do not run git commands to commit them

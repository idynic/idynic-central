## 1. Problem Statement

### Clear Problem Definition

Our microservice architecture currently lacks a standardized approach to event logging and monitoring across services. Each team implements their own logging solution, resulting in inconsistent formats, incomplete data, and difficulty tracking events across service boundaries. This makes debugging production issues time-consuming and error-prone, especially for issues that span multiple services.

### Current Limitations

- Limitation 1: **Inconsistent Log Formats** - Different services use different log formats, making it difficult to correlate events across services.
- Limitation 2: **Distributed Logs** - Logs are stored in different locations (local files, various cloud logging services), making it hard to get a complete picture of system behavior.
- Limitation 3: **Missing Context** - Many logs lack critical context like correlation IDs, making it impossible to trace requests across service boundaries.
- Limitation 4: **Manual Correlation** - Engineers spend an average of 4.5 hours per incident manually correlating logs from different services.
- Limitation 5: **Limited Search Capabilities** - Current logging solutions have limited search and filtering capabilities, increasing time to identify relevant logs.

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Current Value | Target Value | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Time to resolve cross-service incidents | 6.2 hours (avg) | < 3 hours (avg) | Incident resolution time in tracking system |
| Log correlation coverage | 35% of services | 100% of services | Percentage of services using correlation IDs |
| Log search time | 30 minutes (avg) | < 5 minutes (avg) | Time to find relevant logs (measured in user studies) |
| Cross-service trace completeness | 40% (estimated) | > 95% | Percentage of request flows with complete traces |
| Log standardization | 20% of services | 100% of services | Percentage of services using standard log format |

## 2. Proposed Solution

### High-Level Approach

We propose implementing a centralized event logging system that will collect, normalize, and store logs from all services. The system will provide a unified API for logging and a central dashboard for searching and analyzing logs. All services will be updated to use a standard logging client that automatically includes contextual information like correlation IDs.

This approach was chosen over alternative solutions (such as distributed tracing only or improved local logging) because it provides both immediate operational benefits while laying the groundwork for more advanced observability features in the future.

    actor Engineer
    participant Dashboard as Dashboard UI
    participant Search as Search Service
    participant Storage as Log Storage
    
    Engineer->>Dashboard: Enter search criteria
    Dashboard->>Search: Submit query
    Search->>Storage: Retrieve matching logs
    Storage-->>Search: Return results
    Search-->>Dashboard: Format and display
    Dashboard-->>Engineer: Show search results
    Engineer->>Dashboard: Select log for details
    Dashboard-->>Engineer: Display log details
    Engineer->>Dashboard: View related logs
    Dashboard->>Search: Find related logs
    Search-->>Dashboard: Return related logs
    Dashboard-->>Engineer: Display event sequence
```

#### UI/UX Considerations

The dashboard UI will prioritize fast search and filtering capabilities, with intuitive visualization of log sequences. Key features include:

- Query builder with auto-suggestion based on available fields
- Timeline visualization of related events
- One-click navigation between related logs
- Saved searches and alerts
- Service topology view showing message flow

A preliminary wireframe for the main dashboard is available in the design repository at `design-system/mockups/logging-dashboard.fig`.

## 3. Repository Impact

### Primary Repository for Implementation

**Repository**: `idynic-event-logging`

- **Purpose**: New repository for the core logging system components
- **Key Areas for Changes**:
  - `logging-client`: Client SDK for services to use
  - `log-collector`: Service for collecting and processing logs
  - `log-storage`: Service for storing and indexing logs
  - `log-search`: Service for searching and retrieving logs
  - `dashboard-ui`: User interface for log analysis

### Secondary Repositories Requiring Changes

| Repository | Purpose | Required Changes | Impact Level |
|------------|---------|------------------|-------------|
| `idynic-service-template` | Template for new services | Add logging client as standard dependency, update documentation | Medium |
| `idynic-lib-common` | Common libraries used by all services | Add logging interfaces and utilities | Medium |
| `idynic-user-service` | User management service | Update to use new logging client | Low |
| `idynic-order-service` | Order processing service | Update to use new logging client | Low |
| `idynic-catalog-service` | Product catalog service | Update to use new logging client | Low |
| `idynic-deployment` | Deployment configurations | Add configurations for new logging services | Medium |

### Integration Points Affected

```mermaid

    A[idynic-event-logging] --> B[idynic-lib-common]
    B --> C[Service Repositories]
    A --> D[idynic-deployment]
    A --> E[idynic-service-template]
    F[idynic-monitoring] --> A
```

The new logging system will be a required dependency for all services through the common library. Deployment configurations will need to be updated to include the new services. The existing monitoring system will need to be integrated with the new logging system for alerts and dashboards.

## 4. Documentation Impact

### Cross-Repository Documentation Concerns

The logging standards must be consistently documented across all service repositories. We will address this by:

1. Creating comprehensive documentation in the central repository
2. Adding references to this documentation in all service repositories
3. Updating the service template to include these references for new services
4. Adding a section in code reviews to check for proper logging implementation

## 5. Implementation Details

### Key Technical Approaches

- **Log Format**: JSON-structured logs with standardized fields
- **Transport**: HTTP/2 with gRPC for efficient binary transport
- **Storage**: Elasticsearch for indexing and searching
- **Client SDK**: Language-specific SDKs (starting with JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Go)
- **Correlation**: W3C Trace Context standard for cross-service correlation
- **Fallback**: Local disk buffer for outage resilience with automatic retry
- **Sampling**: Configurable sampling for high-volume logs

### Major Components to Modify

| Component | Current State | Planned Modifications | Technical Considerations |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Service Template | Basic console logging | Add structured logging, correlation ID propagation | Must be backward compatible with existing services |
| Common Library | No logging utilities | Add logging interfaces and context propagation | Need to support multiple languages |
| Deployment Pipeline | No log aggregation | Add log collector deployment, storage provisioning | Elasticsearch requires significant resources |
| Monitoring System | Basic metrics only | Add log-based alerting and dashboard integration | Need to avoid duplicate alerts |

### Potential Migration Considerations

| Migration Aspect | Approach | Risks | Mitigation |
|-----------------|----------|-------|------------|
| Existing Services | Incremental migration, one service at a time | Services may temporarily use two logging systems | Add adapter for legacy logs during transition |
| Historical Logs | Import historical logs for critical services | Data volume may be large | Use batch import process during off-hours |
| Team Adoption | Start with 2-3 pilot teams, then expand | Uneven adoption could leave gaps | Create migration plan with deadlines, provide support |
| Performance Impact | Monitor for any performance degradation | Additional logging could impact service performance | Implement sampling, async logging, and benchmarks |

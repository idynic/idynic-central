## System Overview

The Idynic ecosystem consists of multiple repositories that work together to deliver a cohesive platform. This section provides a high-level overview of the system architecture, repositories, and their primary purposes.

### Repository Catalog

| Repository | Purpose | Key Responsibilities |
|------------|---------|---------------------|
| **idynic-central** | Central configurations and workflows | Configuration standards, CI/CD workflows, shared documentation templates |
| **idynic-event-bus** | Event messaging system | Reliable event delivery, message routing, pub/sub infrastructure |
| **[Additional repositories will be added as identified]** | | |

### System Architecture

The overall system architecture is illustrated below, showing the relationships between primary repositories and their place in the overall ecosystem.

    C <--> E
    D <--> E
    E --> F[External Integrations]
```

*Note: This diagram will be updated as additional repositories are identified and documented.*

### Key Data Flows

This section illustrates the key data flows between repositories to provide visibility into how data moves through the system.

#### Workflow Data Flow

```mermaid

    participant User
    participant GitHub
    participant Central as idynic-central
    participant Repo as Repository
    
    User->>GitHub: Create Issue/PR
    GitHub->>Central: Trigger workflow
    Central->>Repo: Update status/create branch
    Repo->>GitHub: Update Issue/PR
    GitHub->>User: Notification
```

*Additional data flows will be documented as repositories and their interactions are identified.*

## Boundary Definitions

Clear boundary definitions are essential for distributed development. This section defines ownership boundaries, interfaces, and responsibilities across repositories.

### Ownership Boundaries

Each repository has specific ownership boundaries for data and functionality. These boundaries help determine where code, data, and functionality should reside.

| Repository | Data Ownership | Functional Ownership | Domain Ownership |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **idynic-central** | Workflow configurations, Documentation templates, Standards definitions | CI/CD pipeline definitions, Organization standards, Cross-repository automation | Organization governance, Developer experience |
| **idynic-event-bus** | Event schemas, Message logs, Delivery metrics | Event publishing, Event subscription, Message routing | Inter-service communication, System integration |
| **[Additional repositories will be added as identified]** | | | |

#### Data Ownership Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each data entity should have a single authoritative source
2. **Local Storage for Local Use**: Data used only within a repository should be stored there
3. **Shared Data Through APIs**: When data is needed across repositories, access via well-defined APIs
4. **Derived Data is Temporary**: Repositories may cache derived data but must handle staleness

### Interface Contracts

Repositories interact through well-defined interfaces. These contracts establish expectations for communication between repositories and ensure reliable integration.

#### GitHub Actions Workflow Interfaces

- **Provider**: idynic-central
- **Consumers**: All repositories
- **Contract**:
  - Workflow files must maintain consistent input/output parameters
  - Breaking changes require version increments
  - Each repository references workflows via specific versions
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  name: Issue Command Handler
  on:
    repository_dispatch:
      types: [issue_command]
  
  jobs:
    handle_command:
      uses: idynic/idynic-central/.github/workflows/issue-comment-commands.yml@v1
      with:
        command: ${{ github.event.client_payload.command }}
      secrets:
        project_token: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_TOKEN }}
  ```

#### Event Bus Interfaces

- **Provider**: idynic-event-bus
- **Consumers**: All service repositories
- **Contract**:
  - Events must conform to defined schemas
  - Publishers must not assume specific consumers
  - Consumers must be resilient to event format changes
  - Event versioning follows semantic versioning
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  // Publishing an event
  eventBus.publish('user.created', {
    version: '1.0',
    data: {
      userId: '123',
      createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
    }
  });
  
  // Subscribing to an event
  eventBus.subscribe('user.created', event => {
    // Handle event
  });
  ```

*Additional interface contracts will be documented as repositories and their interactions are identified.*

### Shared vs. Owned Responsibilities

- **[Additional repositories will be added as identified]**

#### Responsibility Assignment Matrix

For detailed responsibility assignments across repositories, see the [Repository Responsibility Matrix](#repository-responsibility-matrix) in the Appendix.

## Decision Framework

This section provides guidelines for determining where new features should be implemented and how cross-repository features should be handled. A clear decision framework reduces confusion, minimizes disputes, and ensures consistent architectural evolution.

### Feature Placement Decision Tree

The following decision tree helps determine where a new feature should be implemented. Start at the top and follow the path that matches your feature's characteristics.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[New Feature] --> B{Organization-wide?}
    B -->|Yes| BA{Infrastructure or standards?}
    BA -->|Yes| C[idynic-central]
    BA -->|No| BB{Messaging or integration?}
    BB -->|Yes| BC[idynic-event-bus]
    BB -->|No| BD{Domain-specific service?}
    BD -->|Yes| BE[Domain repository]
    BD -->|No| C
    B -->|No| D{Cross-repository?}
    D -->|Yes| E{What is primary functionality?}
    D -->|No| F[Repository-specific]
    E -->|Data exchange| EA[idynic-event-bus]
    E -->|Workflow automation| EB[idynic-central]
    E -->|Domain functionality| EC{Which domain?}
    EC -->|Domain 1| G[Repository 1]
    EC -->|Domain 2| H[Repository 2]
```

#### Decision Questions

Answer these questions to help determine feature placement:

1. **Is this an organization-wide concern?**
   - Affects all/most repositories
   - Standardizes practices
   - Enforces governance

2. **Does it involve cross-repository communication?**
   - Facilitates data exchange
   - Requires coordinated deployments
   - Impacts multiple domains

3. **What is the primary domain?**
   - Where does most logic reside?
   - Who are the primary users?
   - Which team has the most expertise?

4. **Are there technical constraints?**
   - Language/framework dependencies
   - Infrastructure requirements
   - Performance considerations

### Cross-Repository Feature Guidelines

When implementing features that span multiple repositories, follow these guidelines to ensure smooth integration and maintainability.

#### Planning Phase

1. **Identify Primary Owner**: Determine which repository owns the core functionality
   - Consider domain alignment
   - Consider team expertise
   - Identify where most logic will reside

2. **Define Interfaces**: Clearly define the interfaces between repositories
   - Document data schemas
   - Specify API contracts
   - Identify event patterns
   - Version all interfaces

3. **Create Implementation Plan**:
   - Identify dependencies between repositories
   - Create linked issues in all affected repositories
   - Establish timeline with dependencies in mind
   - Document rollback procedures

#### Implementation Phase

4. **Coordinate Changes**:
   - Use linked issues in GitHub
   - Hold regular sync meetings with involved teams
   - Establish communication channel for the feature
   - Share progress updates across teams

5. **Sequence Deployments**:
   - Deploy changes in dependency order
   - Use feature flags for coordinated releases
   - Consider canary deployments for high-risk changes
   - Monitor for integration issues

6. **Test End-to-End**:
   - Ensure comprehensive testing across repository boundaries
   - Create integration test suites
   - Test failure scenarios and edge cases
   - Verify backward compatibility

#### Example: Cross-Repository Feature Implementation

**Feature**: Workflow notifications for issue status changes

* **Primary Owner**: `idynic-central` (owns workflow automation)
* **Involved Repositories**:
  * `idynic-central`: Workflow definitions
  * `idynic-event-bus`: Message delivery
  * `notification-service`: User notifications

* **Implementation Sequence**:
  1. Event schema definition in `idynic-event-bus`
  2. Workflow changes in `idynic-central`
  3. Notification handler in `notification-service`

### Boundary Dispute Resolution

When there is uncertainty or disagreement about where a feature belongs, follow this resolution process:

#### Resolution Process

1. **Initial Discussion**:
   - Repository owners discuss and attempt to reach consensus
   - Clearly document points of agreement and disagreement
   - Focus on architectural principles rather than team preferences

2. **Technical Analysis**:
   - Analyze coupling between components
   - Evaluate data ownership considerations
   - Consider deployment and operational impacts
   - Document findings and recommendations

3. **Escalation Path**:
   - If consensus cannot be reached, escalate to architecture review board
   - Schedule a dedicated review session
   - All involved parties present their perspectives
   - Architecture board makes final decision

4. **Decision Criteria**:
   - **Strategic alignment**: Aligns with long-term technical strategy
   - **Technical cohesion**: Logically fits with existing functionality
   - **Minimal coupling**: Reduces dependencies between repositories
   - **Team expertise**: Aligns with team ownership and knowledge
   - **Operational efficiency**: Simplifies deployment and monitoring
   - **User experience**: Provides the best developer/user experience

5. **Documentation**:
   - Document the final decision and rationale in the related issues
   - Update the Repository Map if boundaries change
   - Communicate decision to all stakeholders
   - Create a precedent for similar future decisions

#### Dispute Resolution Examples

**Example 1**: Authentication hooks in different services

* **Dispute**: Should authentication hooks live in each service or in a central auth service?
* **Resolution**: Authentication rules and verification in central auth service, with service-specific hooks in each repository for custom authorization logic
* **Rationale**: Centralized authentication for consistency and security, distributed authorization for flexibility and domain-specific rules

**Example 2**: Shared UI components

* **Dispute**: Should UI components be duplicated in each frontend repository or maintained in a shared component library?
* **Resolution**: Core components in shared library, specialized components in respective repositories
* **Rationale**: Balance between consistency (shared components) and domain-specific flexibility (specialized components)

## Governance

This section outlines how repository boundaries are managed and updated over time. Effective governance ensures that the repository ecosystem evolves in a controlled, predictable manner while allowing for innovation and adaptation.

### Repository Boundary Updates

### Cross-Cutting Decision Authority

Authority for decisions that impact multiple repositories is clearly defined to prevent uncertainty and ensure appropriate stakeholder involvement.

#### Decision Authority Matrix

| Decision Type | Authority | Approval Process | Documentation | Timeline |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|---------------|----------|
| Technical Standards | Architecture Team | RFC + Review | Standards Doc | 2-4 weeks |
| Organization Standards | Leadership Team | Proposal + Vote | Governance Doc | 2-4 weeks |
| Repository Boundaries | Repository Owners + Architecture Team | Consensus Required | Repository Map Update | 1-3 weeks |
| API Changes | Service Owners + Consumers | Contract Review | API Documentation | 1-2 weeks |
| Technology Selection | Architecture Team | POC + Review | Selection Document | 4-8 weeks |
| Emergency Changes | On-Call Team | Post-implementation Review | Incident Report | Immediate |

#### Decision Escalation Path

When decisions cannot be made at the designated level or when decisions are contested:

1. **Initial Level**: Team leads and repository owners
2. **First Escalation**: Architecture team
3. **Second Escalation**: CTO/VP Engineering
4. **Final Decision**: CEO (rare cases only)

Each escalation should include:
- Clear statement of the problem
- Options considered
- Recommendations
- Impact analysis of each option

### Change Impact Assessment

Guidelines for assessing the impact of changes across repositories help ensure appropriate levels of scrutiny, communication, and testing.

#### Impact Levels

- **Level 1**: Single repository, no interface changes
  - *Example*: Refactoring internal code, updating non-shared dependencies
  - *Risk*: Low

- **Level 2**: Single repository, interface changes
  - *Example*: Adding API endpoints, changing request/response format
  - *Risk*: Medium

- **Level 3**: Multiple repositories, compatible changes
  - *Example*: Adding shared functionality, extending existing interfaces
  - *Risk*: High

- **Level 4**: Multiple repositories, breaking changes
  - *Example*: Changing authentication mechanisms, major API version changes
  - *Risk*: Very High

#### Required Actions by Impact Level

| Impact Level | Notification | Documentation | Testing | Approvals | Deployment Strategy |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| Level 1 | Repository Team | Repository Docs | Unit/Integration | Team Lead | Standard |
| Level 2 | Dependent Teams | Interface Docs | Interface Tests | Team Lead | Staged |
| Level 3 | All Teams | System Docs | System Tests | All Affected Team Leads | Coordinated |
| Level 4 | All Teams + Management | Full System Docs | Full Regression | Architecture Team | Orchestrated |

#### Change Impact Assessment Process

For any significant change:

1. **Identify Impact Level**: Determine which level the change falls under
2. **Complete Impact Questionnaire**:
   - Which repositories are directly affected?
   - Which repositories are indirectly affected?
   - Are there API changes? Breaking or backward compatible?
   - Are there data schema changes?
   - Are there workflow changes?
   - Are there security implications?

3. **Create Change Plan**:
   - Communication strategy
   - Testing strategy
   - Rollout strategy
   - Rollback plan
   - Monitoring approach

4. **Obtain Required Approvals**:
   - Based on impact level
   - Document approvals in the change request

5. **Follow Through**:
   - Execute according to plan
   - Document any deviations
   - Conduct post-implementation review

### Repository Lifecycle Management

Guidelines for creating new repositories and retiring old ones ensure a well-maintained ecosystem.

#### Creating New Repositories

1. **Propose new repository**: Create issue in idynic-central
2. **Justify creation**: Document why existing repositories aren't suitable
3. **Define boundaries**: Clear ownership and interfaces
4. **Create repository**: Use standard template
5. **Update Repository Map**: Add to this document
6. **Establish governance**: Set up ownership and access controls

#### Repository Retirement Process

1. **Identify candidate**: Repositories with low activity or superseded functionality
2. **Assess impact**: Identify dependencies and users
3. **Create migration plan**: How functionality/data will be preserved
4. **Execute migration**: Move required functionality
5. **Archive repository**: Make read-only
6. **Update Repository Map**: Mark as archived
7. **Communicate**: Notify stakeholders of archive status
